"""
Temporal: Individual Fits
=========================

In this script, we will fit multiple charge injection imaging to calibrate CTI, where:

 - The CTI model consists of one parallel `TrapInstantCapture` species.
 - The `CCD` volume filling is a simple parameterization with just a `well_fill_power` parameter.
 - The `ImagingCI` is simulated with uniform charge injection lines and no cosmic rays.

The multiple datasets are representative of CTI calibration data taken over the course of a space mission. Therefore,
the model-fitting aims to determine the increase in the density of traps with time.

This script fits each dataset one-by-one and uses the results post-analysis to determine the density evolution
parameters. Other scripts perform more detailed analyses that use more advanced statistical methods to provide a
better estimate.

The charge injection data is a small cut-out of 30 x 30 pixels, to make CTI calibration run fast for the overview
script that this data is used for.
