"""
Temporal: Individual Temporal
=============================

In the script `individual_fits.py` we fitted multiple charge injection datasets one-by-one.

These datasets were simulated to represent different times in a space mission, such that the density of traps
linearly increases across the datasets.

In this script we load the results of these model fits and estimate how the density evolves linearly with time.

Using the database and aggregator, we can now compute lists of the estimate density of traps for every model fit,
including errors, alongside the number of months into the space mission the fitted dataset corresponds too.
